This is a project that simulates the card game called President. The object of the game is to be the first person to empty his or her hand. 

Game Mechanics:

	The deck is split amongst all the participating players. Whoever has the 3 of spades places it into the pile. Play then passes to the next person in the sequence. Each player has several options. If a player has a card with the same number as the card on the top of the pile, the player can play that card to skip the next person. If a player sees one, two, or three cards of the same number on the top of the pile, and the player has the last card to make four-of-a-kind, then the player can complete the set in order to clear the pile. Once the pile is cleared, then the person who cleared it can play whatever combination of cards they would like and that is permitted. Permitted combinations include playing one card, two-of-a-kind, three-of-a-kind, or four-of-a-kind (which will clear the pile again). Play then passes to the next player. 2 (of any suit) is a special card in that it will clear the pile no matter what combination is on the top of the pile. A player can decide to pass if he or she feels that they either do not want to play or cannot play. A key rule to the game is that a player can only play a card or cards that are greater than or equal to the value of the top card.
